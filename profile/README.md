# Governance Policies and Political Landscapes in the Southern Levant under the Neo-Assyrian Empire

This planned two-year project will make use of a holistic approach integrating archaeological, textual and geographical data into a spatial framework to have a better understanding of the Assyrian imperial policies occurring in the Southern Levant region. Unlike the patchiness in the archaeological dataset in the Assyrian heartland and the northern frontier of the empire, the Southern Levant is a privileged area for the study of Assyrian imperialism given that likely has the largest archaeological dataset in the world (hundreds of archaeological excavations and detailed surveys) augmented by a relatively large number of textual evidence found both in the region and Mesopotamia (e.g., Assyrian royal inscriptions, administrative documents and correspondence relating to the region). In addition, this area is characterised by a variety of different polities (e.g., Assyrian provinces, client states) requiring the implementation of a wide range of governance strategies by the imperial Assyrian administration to maintain and consolidate its power in the area. Therefore, for the first time, this project will systematically analyse the unparallel information from the region to avoid any misinterpretation due to partial use of the disposable data and to shed new light not only on the Assyrian governance policies but also on the local responses to the imperial activity.
